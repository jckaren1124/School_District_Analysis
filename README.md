# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine school funding for the following year. School performance based on the percentage of students who passed reading and math were calculated and compared against school spending, school size, and school type. This information can potentially provide insights to the school board on what factors play a role in school performance; thereby making an educated decision on allocating school funds to achieve the best outcomes.

However, a recent report indicated that student scores from ninth graders at Thomas High School may have been altered. Therefore, these scores were removed from the data and new sets of calculations were made to compare with the previous data.

## Results
#### District Summary
•	The original district summary data is slightly higher than the revised district summary after removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School.  The average math and reading scores were lower in the revised data by hundredths of a percent while the percent passing math and percent passing reading data showed a slighter larger change with lower percentage scores by tenths of a percent. The biggest change can be seen in the overall passing percentage with the revised data showing a lower passing rate by 0.32%. As the whole, removing the data from ninth graders from Thomas High School did not generate any changes if all the calculated information was rounded to the nearest whole number.
