# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine school funding for the following year. School performance based on the percentage of students who passed reading and math were calculated and compared against school spending, school size, and school type. This information can potentially provide insights to the school board on what factors play a role in school performance; thereby making an educated decision on allocating school funds to achieve the best outcomes.

However, a recent report indicated that student scores from ninth graders at Thomas High School may have been altered. Therefore, these scores were removed from the data and new sets of calculations were made to compare with the previous data.

## Results
#### District Summary
•	The original district summary data is slightly higher than the revised district summary after removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School.  The average math and reading scores were lower in the revised data by hundredths of a percent while the percent passing math and percent passing reading data showed a slighter larger change with lower percentage scores by tenths of a percent. The biggest change can be seen in the overall passing percentage with the revised data showing a lower passing rate by 0.32%. As the whole, removing the data from ninth graders from Thomas High School did not generate any changes if all the calculated information was rounded to the nearest whole number.

•	Only minute changes were seen for scores by school spending in the $630-644 spending range. Only the average reading score was slightly higher in the revised data while the rest of the scores and passing percentages were a little higher in the original data. If the scores were rounded to the nearest whole number, then no changes could be detected at all.

•	For the scores by school size data, very slight changes in the calculations for medium schools can be seen. The original data has slightly higher scores on all categories.

•	Since Thomas High School is a charter school, it is understandable that only the charter school data was affected by the revision. Again, the changes are minute, but only the average reading score was higher in the revised data while all other categories were higher in the original data calculations.

## Summary

Overall, the average math and reading scores as well as the passing percentage rates for all subjects were only slightly lower after removing the ninth grader scores at Thomas High School.  No change could be detected if all data were rounded to the nearest numbers. The biggest change in the revised data can be seen under the school summary chart. Even though average math scores and average reading scores were only slightly lower in the revised data calculations, the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both were significantly lower in the revised school summary chart.
